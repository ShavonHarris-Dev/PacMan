Exciting game that I refactored from Ania Kubow. The focus on this project was practixing using advanced JS functions.

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

My learning was focused on pseudocoding and following that pseudocode to completion. It was also focused on practcing constructors.  

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would add the characters to make the user experience more interesting.
## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget to update the images.
